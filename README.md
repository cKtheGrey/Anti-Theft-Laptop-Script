# Anti-Theft-Laptop-Script
The idea behind this script is to potentially catch a thief, and it does so by deploying a script automatically on log in (guest honeypot user). The script then takes a picture of the perpetrator from the webcam, automatically connects to the strongest wifi signal, gets the current geolocation, sends all this information to an email or SSH server instantly and then starts up a keylogger that will periodically send further information it attains, which can help us build a profile on this individual. There is also a built in custom bootloader image that might get noticed by computer repair shop, if the thief chooses to reformat right away and sell your laptop. 

You can take a look at a video demonstration here:
